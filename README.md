# AI Practical Assignment â€“ Health Insurance Cost Prediction  

## Task Description  
This project involves developing a **Machine Learning model** using the **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** algorithm to predict future healthcare costs for a health insurance company. The goal is to provide a fair and accurate estimation of insurance premiums based on customer profiles.  

### Dataset  
- **dataset.csv**: Contains historical customer data with cost values.  
- **just_features.csv**: Contains customer profiles without cost values for prediction.  

### Tasks  
1. Implement a **Jupyter Notebook** solution using **Scikit-Learn** and other Python libraries.  
2. Train and evaluate an **SVM-based regression model**.  
3. Predict costs for the given test dataset and save the results in **grupo#_custos_estimados.csv**.  
4. Prepare a **brief presentation** of the work in **grupo#_apresentacao.pdf**.  

### Extra Credit (+2 Points)  
- Analyze and identify which features have the most influence on healthcare costs using feature importance techniques.  

### Implementation Guidelines  
- Use **Scikit-Learn** and other Python support packages introduced in the course.  
- Follow best practices for **data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation**.  
- Maintain **code clarity and documentation** within the Jupyter Notebook.
